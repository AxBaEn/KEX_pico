Code for bachelors project in course EF112X - microcontroller to regulate V/A switching regulator

Code to control a switching power supply meant to charge batteries that need a certain voltage/ampere level as part of their charge cycle. This coe runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico and regulates the V/A to desired levels as set by a connected Raspberry Pi over a CAN-interface.

Uses connected voltage sensor and ammeter to close the control loop.
